When sleep is removed, this allows for the threads to constantly retry gaining access to the resources/semaphores it needs to complete its unit of work. This ends up with the program taking on average, less time to run. When sleep is introduced, we are artificially increasing the critical time of processes that have access to the semaphores, thus leading to other processes not gaining access.
